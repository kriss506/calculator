# Simple Calculator

This simple calculator allows the user to enter
a string of calculations eg 1+2+3\*4/5

The javascript eval function performs the calculation ensuring the correct
order of operations rules are applied. eg multiplication and division
before addition and subtraction (brackets buttons are not provided).

A backspace key can be used to delete the last characters of the equation string.

When the answer is calculated after the equals key is pressed, the user can
click another operator button to use the answer as a starting point for
a new equation.

If a digit is clicked after the answer has been displayed,
the calculator is reset.
